# pridhvipinninti-Endometriosis_Question_Answering
This project aims to develop a question-answering system focused on endometriosis based on real-time Interviews from experts and specialists. The system is built using Fast API for the web framework and employs the “Sentence Transformer” model to provide relevant answers to user queries.


The data used in this project consists of transcript documents extracted from the personal interviews. These documents encompass various aspects, including symptoms, treatment options, patient experiences, and medical research findings. The data is collected from real-time medical experts, and patient advocates. Each document contains a question and a corresponding context or answer, forming the basis for the question-answering model.
